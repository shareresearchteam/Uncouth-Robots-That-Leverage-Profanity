# Uncouth-Robots-That-Leverage-Profanity
Video stimuli, additional figure, and supplementary statistical and qualitative analysis results as further explained in the under-review RA-L submission: Oh F**k! How do People Feel about Robots that Leverage Profanity?

**Video Stimuli Folder:** Includes all nine videos (~9s each) described in the paper. For these videos, the naming convention is "behavior_condition.mp4"

**In_Person_Figure:** This image shows the robot setup for distributing gift bags during the In-Person Pilot Deployment.

**Augmented_Student_Pool_Stats:** This file shows the full statistical test result tables for the university-student-focused study (i.e., first study) outlined in the manuscript body. This information includes the complete post hoc testing results.

**Augmented_Prolific_Stats:** This file shows the full statistical test result tables for the broader online study (i.e., second study) outlined in the manuscript body. This information includes the complete post hoc testing results.

**Augmented_In_Person_Stats:** This file shows the full statistical test result tables for the in-person deployment (i.e., third experiment) covered in the manuscript body. This information includes the full post hoc testing results.

**Survey_Inventory_Reliability_Analysis:** This file explains how we tested whether the scales used in the discussed experiments were reliable, including strong evidence of the scales' reliability.

**Possible_Ordering_Effects_and_Likely_Covariates:** This file includes exploratory tests to ensure the usefulness and validity of our results. Specifically, we looked for an found no evidence of ordering effects and little evidence of age as a meaningful covariate within our sample.

**Qualitative_Analyses_of_the_Experiment_Data:** This file includes qualitative analysis results related to each of the experiments discussed in the paper body. Although not crucial for understanding the core work, these results can help to augment the reader's understanding of what to do leading out from the work discussed in our paper.
